#### 📌 Description
- Built a **command-line calculator** in C capable of handling **arbitrary-precision numbers** beyond built-in data type limits.  
- Designed a user defined structure `number` storing digits as a **doubly linked list**, with fields for **sign** and **decimal precision**.  
- Implemented a **stack-based infix expression evaluator** and a **finite state machine (FSM)** to parse and compute user input efficiently.  
- Supported operations including **addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, negative numbers, and expression evaluation**.
