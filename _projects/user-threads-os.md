**Project Overview:**
Built a user-level multi-threading library in C, supporting one-one, many-one, and many-many mapping models.

**Key Highlights:**
- Exposed APIs for thread lifecycle management, implemented synchronization primitives like spinlock and signal handlers for over 50+ signals.
- Validated models using race conditions and achieved 80% reduction in execution time for matrix multiplications.

**Technologies Used:**
C, Systems Programming, Multithreading, Coroutines, Bash
