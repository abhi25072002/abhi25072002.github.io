**Project Overview:**
Divided the problem into classification and localization/detection tasks, conducting research for each separately.

**Key Highlights:**
- Proposed Vision Transformer as the feature extractor backbone for Detection Transformer, achieving mAP@0.5 of 82.9% on the cottonweed dataset, a 7% improvement over state-of-the-art CNN-based detectors.
- Published a survey paper at IEEE ASIANCON, providing a detailed taxonomy of weed detection techniques and the future potential of ViT in real-time smart farming solutions.

**Technologies Used:**
Python, Vision Transformers, Deep Learning
