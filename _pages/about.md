Hi!

I am Abhishek! I am currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science (MSCS) at Georgia Tech with a specialization in Machine Learning. I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering with honors in Data Science from the College of Engineering, Pune (COEP), where I received the Department and Institute Gold Medals for achieving the highest CGPA of 9.81/10 in a batch of 780 students.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at Wells Fargo, where I got my first experience with production-grade system by developing and maintaining the Independent Price Verification tool and contributing to full-stack development, SDLC processes, and Agile workflow. I was also a research Intern at MIDAS Lab, IIIT Delhi, where I created Indian context benchmark datasets and evaluated the reasoning capabilities of open-source large language models in physics and geometry domain. I also completed a Summer Internship at Citi, where I helped migrate an in-house process automation tool UI. Earlier, I was part of the ISRO COEP Satellite Team (CSAT), where worked on satellite attitude determination and control algorithms.

My interests are in Machine Learning & Deep Learning, Multimodal Large Language Models, Systems for Machine Learning, and Full-stack Software Engineering.

I recently started hitting the gym for weight loss, and now it has kind of become a habit. I’ve already lost some weight, and it’s a really good feeling! In my free time, I used to love just watching cooking recipes, but now I actually have to prepare meals as well (no choice here in the United States). I also enjoy watching web series.

`I am actively seeking Summer 2026 Software Engineering internship opportunities!`
