Hi, I’m Abhishek Dharmadhikari, a Master’s student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, specializing in Machine Learning.

I completed my Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering (Honors in Data Science) from the College of Engineering, Pune (COEP), where I graduated Rank 1 with a CGPA of 9.81/10 and was awarded both the Department and Institute Gold Medals among a cohort of 780 students.

Prior to my master’s, I worked as a Software Engineer at Wells Fargo, where I contributed to the development and maintenance of the Independent Price Verification (IPV) platform. My work involved full-stack development, production debugging, SDLC processes, and Agile collaboration on a large-scale, regulated financial system.



I have also gained research experience as a Research Intern at the MIDAS Lab, IIIT Delhi, where I built Indian-context benchmark datasets and evaluated the reasoning capabilities of open-source large language models in physics and geometry. Earlier, during my Summer Internship at Citi, I supported the migration of an internal process automation tool’s UI.

My interests are in Machine Learning & Deep Learning, Multimodal Large Language Models, and Full-stack Software Engineering.

<!-- I recently started hitting the gym for weight loss, and now it has kind of become a habit. I’ve already lost some weight, and it’s a really good feeling! In my free time, I used to love just watching cooking recipes, but now I actually have to prepare meals as well (no choice here in the United States). I also enjoy watching web series. -->
