Hi! I'm Abhishek.   

`I am actively seeking Summer 2026 Software Engineering internship opportunities.`

I am currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science (MSCS) at Georgia Tech with a specialization in Machine Learning. I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering with honors in Data Sciencefrom the College of Engineering, Pune (COEP), where I received the Department and Institute Gold Medals for achieving the highest CGPA of 9.81/10 in a batch of 780 students.

My interests are in Machine Learning & Deep Learning, Multimodal Large Language Models, Systems for Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, and Full-stack Software Engineering.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at Wells Fargo, where I gained my first experience working on production-grade systems, developing and maintaining the Independent Price Verification tool, and taking part in full-stack development, SDLC processes, and Agile settings. I was a research Intern at MIDAS Lab, IIIT Delhi, where I created benchmark datasets and evaluated the reasoning capabilities of open-source large language models in physics and geometry with an Indian context. I also completed a Summer Internship at Citi, where I helped migrate an in-house process automation tool UI. Earlier, I was part of the ISRO COEP Satellite Team (CSAT), where worked on satellite attitude determination and control algorithms.

I recently started hitting the gym for weight loss, and now it has kind of become a habit. I’ve already lost some weight, and it’s a really good feeling! In my free time, I used to love just watching cooking recipes, but now I actually have to prepare meals as well (no choice here in the United States). I also enjoy watching web series.
